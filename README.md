# AVL-Tree
This project implements an AVL Tree in Python, a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains height balance through rotations. It supports insertion, deletion, and preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals. User commands (A&lt;value>, D&lt;value>, PRE, IN, POST) allow dynamic tree updates while ensuring efficient operations.
